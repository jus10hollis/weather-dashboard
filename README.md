## A seemigly simple weather dashboard

As you can see, I'm still working on it.

```With assistance from tutor: Jude Clark; TA: Ben Martin; and instructor: Stephen Oveson. Some structures I implemented I learned from Jonah Lawrence's YouTube Video "Build a Weather App with HTML, CSS & JavaScript"
   <a href="https://youtu.be/WZNG8UomjSI">. Some of the methods I used we haven't covered in the course yet, but I've read the documentation and discussed these approaches with my instructor.
